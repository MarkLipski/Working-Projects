# Electrostatic Solver
## Purpose
A project I occasionally work on, stemming from the fact that I wanted to understand circuits at an electrostatic level. I felt that I didn't understand what voltage was (at a very fundamental level), and how it was expressed in terms of forces in a circuit. The goal of this project is to reinforce my understanding of electrostatic fundamentals.

## 1-D Electrostatic Solver
I initially began with a 1-D solver which I hoped to use to get a simple approximation of how circuits worked at an electrostatic level. I'm assuming that we can use the electronic cloud model, and assuming little else.

### Results
After spending some time on the 1-D solver, and thinking about the fundamentals, as well as doing some math, 1-D circuits make virtually no sense. Conceptually, there's no way to actually complete a loop in 1-D, and none of the math actually ended up working out in a meaningful way. See the project for details.

## 2-D Electrostatic Solver
Current work in progress. See project for details.
